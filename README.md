# QuantLongShort
Long/short value momentum portfolio

This is a long/short value portfolio with a momentum tilt. It uses value factors as well as relative strenght to rank stocks in the given universe. Each month it rebalances the portfolio based on the new factor rankings.

Currently, the portfolio does well from 2002 to 2013, outperforming the market for most of this time and staying positive during the great recession, all wile having a low beta. After 2013, however, the strategy does not work as well and underperforms the market.

Goals: use machine learning to better rank stocks.

# QuantLongShort
Long/short value momentum portfolio

This is a long/short value portfolio with a momentum tilt. It uses value factors as well as relative strength to rank stocks in the given universe. Each month it rebalances the portfolio based on the new factor rankings.

Currently, the portfolio does well from 2002 to 2013, outperforming the market for most of this time and staying positive during the great recession, all while having a low beta. After 2013, however, the strategy underperforms the market.

Goals:
Implement more indicators with low correlation
Use machine learning to better rank stocks
